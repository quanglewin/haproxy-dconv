# HAProxy Documentation Converter

Made to convert the HAProxy documentation into HTML.

More than HTML, the main goal is to provide easy navigation.

## Documentation

A job periodically fetches last commits from HAProxy 1.4 to the latest dev branch and produces up-to-date documentation.

Links are available from http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/

## Contribute

The project now lives by itself, as it is sufficiently useable. But I'm sure we can do even better.
Feel free to report feature requests or provide patches !
